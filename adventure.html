        <h2 id="title">Adventuring The New Theory</h2>

    <p> In 2021, there was a physicist named Jame Dame who was working on some scientific <br>
        reseach and while doing those research he came to think of a theory. In his line of thinking and reasoning<br>
        he thought that human beings can be good conductors of electricity. So he began his adventure <br>
        in to this line of thinking and started to figure out some of the ways by which he can carry out <br>
        the experiment to prove this theory. One way to carry out this experiment was to take himself as the <br>
        subject to test the theory. Upon thinking on when to publish this theory he came up with two choices.<br>

        <br>
        <p class="choice"><b>choice 1:</b></p><a href= "test1.html"> To test himself if he can conduct electricity without dying</a>
        <br><br>
        <img src='img/img1.jpg' width="300px" height="200px" >
        <br><br>
        <p class="choice"><b>choice 2:</b> </p><a href="test2.html">Not to publish this new discovery if he can't do choice 1 but continue find posible ways of doing the experiment</a>
        <br><br>
        <img src='img/img2.jpg' width="300px" height="200px"> <br><br>
        After some carefull decision on the choices above, he decided not to publish this theory. Therefore<br>
        it is up to other scientist who are willing to take on this research and prove to others that humans can <br>
         actually be conductors of electricity. However Jame Dame outline some points to take note of in doing this experiment.<br>
         These includes.
        <ul>
            <i>
            <li>Make sure the subject is a living person to conducting the research.</li>
            <li>Don't do it if you change your mind.</li>
            <li>The theory has nothing to do with any researcher failing his/her experiment. </li>
            <li>This is just a theory, thus carefull experiment should be done. </li>
        </i>
        </ul>
        This is still a new theory and much of it has not been written down as yet but a full publication of why<br>
        and how this theory came about will be publish on this Adventure site. So stay up to date with us to catch this
        amazing dicovery!.
